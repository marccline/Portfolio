**THE DATASET**

The dataset contains data of cars. The dataset contains 205 rows and 26
columns and includes data on make of the car and details about car
dimensions, fuel types/consumption, engine characteristics, and price.

**PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT**

The purpose of the project is to find out:

-   Which cars in the dataset are the most powerful at the lowest price?

-   The relationship between various body styles and:

    -   Fuel consumption;

    -   Fuel type;

    -   Weight; and

    -   Horsepower

**HOW DATA ARE ANALYSED**

Scatterplots are used to determine relationships between:

-   Power-to-weight ratio and price

-   Weight and fuel consumption

The vehicles in the dataset are organised in body types (sedan, wagon,
hatchback, hardtop, convertible), and plots (bar and pie) are utilised
to determine:

-   Highway driving fuel consumption (gas vehicles vs diesel vehicles)

-   City driving fuel consumption (gas vs diesel)

-   Vehicle weight (gas vs diesel)

-   Vehicle horsepower (gas vs diesel)

**MAIN FINDINGS**

-   The two cars in the dataset that are the most powerful at the lowest
    price are Mercury Hatchback Turbo (ID 75) and Nissan hatchback turbo
    (ID 105) They both have power-to-weight rations above 60 and are
    priced at under \$20Â 000.

-   Over 80% of the dataset consists of sedan and hatchback body types.

-   Fuel consumption (gas vs diesel) across both highway driving and
    city driving is mostly as expected, i.e. diesel vehicles are more
    fuel efficient than gas vehicles.

-   There is an inverse relationship between weight and fuel
    consumption, i.e., an increase in weight results in lower mpg.

**CAVEAT**

The automobile dataset is small, with only 205 entries. The accuracy and
veracity of the data is further called into question with regards to the
segmentation of the data into the different body styles.
