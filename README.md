#### SHORT BIO
I believe in alchemy, pulling seemingly disparate ideas/concepts together and creating something new. I am analytical, data-driven and extremely thorough. At the same time, I am a creative thinker and visionary, often sowing seeds of original inspiration for others to build upon. 

Besides working as a strategy consultant for many years, I am also a professional musician, having composed music for feature film, documentaries, and advertisements, as well as playing many gigs and sessions as a guitarist and keyboardist. 

I am extremely motivated, high-energy worker who inspires those around me. As an open-minded student of life I am always willing to participate and contribute as constructively and as meaningfully as I can.
